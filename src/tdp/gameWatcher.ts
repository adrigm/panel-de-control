/**
 * Persistent "current game" watcher, started once at plugin load (definePlugin)
 * and torn down on unload. It lives OUTSIDE the QAM content tree, so it runs
 * while Steam is running regardless of whether the user has opened the panel.
 *
 * This is the SINGLE source that reports the running game to the backend via
 * setCurrentGame(appid | null). The backend needs this so the auto-TDP loop,
 * the telemetry sampler and the fan auto-apply activate the right per-game
 * profile — otherwise, after a plugin_loader restart, the backend thinks no
 * game is running until the user opens the QAM (which is what mounts the UI
 * hooks), leaving auto-TDP inert on a game that is already running.
 *
 * useRunningGame is now a LOCAL UI read only — it does NOT report to the
 * backend, so there is no double-report / race with this watcher.
 *
 * Robustness (the crux of the restart bug — two failure modes):
 *  1. Router.MainRunningApp hydrates ASYNC. At plugin load the initial read can
 *     still be null even though a game is already running, and
 *     RegisterForAppLifetimeNotifications does NOT re-emit for an already-running
 *     game → the backend would stay at appid=None forever. So we run a bounded
 *     startup poll (every ~2 s) until we have SUCCESSFULLY reported a real appid,
 *     independent of whether the event API exists.
 *  2. The backend RPC may not be ready at load. We commit `lastAppid` ONLY after
 *     setCurrentGame RESOLVES OK; on rejection we leave it so the next tick retries.
 *
 * Reports only on appid change (never the same appid twice, once committed).
 * Degrades: if the Steam/Decky API is unavailable or throws, it never throws.
